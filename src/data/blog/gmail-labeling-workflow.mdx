  labels them, deletes spam, and sends recruitment email summaries to Discord.
---

Managing your inbox doesn't have to be a chore. With [n8n](https://n8n.io/), you can build a workflow that not only **categorizes emails automatically** using AI but also **notifies you about important job offers** in real time via Discord.

In this post, I'll walk you through a production-ready workflow that:

- Runs every **10 minutes** to check for new emails.
- Classifies each message into **6 categories** using GPT-powered classification.
- Labels emails in Gmail accordingly.
- Marks selected messages as read.
- Summarizes job offers and posts them to a Discord channel.

Let's see how it works.

## 🎯 Workflow Overview

Below is the high-level flow:

1. **Scheduled Trigger**  
   Runs every 10 minutes.

2. **Fetch Unread Emails**  
   Retrieves all unread messages via the Gmail node.

3. **AI Classification**  
   Uses a **LangChain Text Classifier** powered by OpenAI to assign one of these categories:
   - Personal
   - Recruitment
   - Social
   - Bills
   - Spam
   - System Notifications

4. **Label Actions**  
   Depending on the classification, the workflow:
   - Adds Gmail labels.
   - Marks messages as read (for Social and System Notifications).
   - Deletes spam automatically.

5. **Job Offer Summarization**  
   If the email is a **Recruitment message**:
   - Fetches the full content.
   - Summarizes key details like position, salary range, tools, and contract type using GPT.
   - Sends a nicely formatted summary to a Discord channel.

Here's an example of what gets posted to Discord:

> 💼 **New Job Offer**
>
> - **Title:** Frontend Developer Opportunity
> - **Position:** Frontend Developer
> - **Salary:** 15k-20k PLN B2B
> - **Technologies:** React, TypeScript
> - **Contract:** B2B
> - **Mode:** Remote
> - **Company:** Acme Corp, SaaS
> - [View Offer](https://...)
> - [Company Website](https://...)

## 🛠️ Key Nodes and Logic

### 🟢 Schedule Trigger
Runs every 10 minutes to keep your inbox clean and up to date.

```json
{
  "rule": {
    "interval": [
      {
        "field": "minutes",
        "minutesInterval": 10
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 🟢 Gmail: Fetch Unread Messages
Pulls in all new, unread emails.

---

### 🟢 OpenAI: Text Classification
Uses GPT-4o-mini to categorize emails.
Each category has a clear description, for example:

- **Recruitment**: Messages with job offers.
- **Spam**: Unsolicited or suspicious content.

---

### 🟢 Labeling Logic
Depending on the category:

- **Personal**: Apply a *Personal* label.
- **Recruitment**: Apply a *Recruitment* label.
- **Social**: Apply *Social* label and mark as read.
- **Rachunki**: Apply *Bills* label.
- **System Notifications**: Apply label and mark as read.
- **Spam**: Delete automatically.

---

### 🟢 Job Offer Summarization
When a message is categorized as **Recruitment**, this workflow:

1. Retrieves the full HTML content.
2. Prompts GPT to extract structured information.
3. Posts the summary to Discord via a webhook.

---

## ✨ Why This Is Useful

- **Never miss a job offer again**—get instant Discord alerts.
- Keep your inbox organized with minimal manual effort.
- Use AI to categorize messages with high accuracy.
- Automatically delete spam, reducing clutter.

## 🚀 How To Use This Workflow

1. **Install n8n** if you haven't already.
2. Create credentials for:
   - Gmail OAuth2
   - OpenAI API
   - Discord Webhook
3. Import the workflow JSON (or recreate manually). [Link](https://github.com/PilarczykM/AI-Notes/tree/main/n8n/gmail_label_and_notify)
